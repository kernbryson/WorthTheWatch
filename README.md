# WorthTheWatch

 Seeing that everyone is looking to watch a movie though there are so many choices it is nice to have an easy way to search and look up the movies either by genre or title.
 
 ## User Story

AS a Movie Buff
I want a website that provides me with all the information I need about a movie
So THAT I can decide if the movie is WORTH THE WATCH
## Expected Goals

* If I search for a film or television show by title or genre 
Then I am presented with search results resembling my search query
The results will display a brief description of the movie including plot rating and movie poster
* When I click a movie image i am taken to another page that displays more detailed information about that movie including the movie rating, director, main actors, and a youtube trailer
* When i click on previous searches a card appears with the previously searched movies 

## Technologies used

* we used the imdb and youtube api to gather data from their servers using api keys

     -[imdb](https://imdb-api.com/api) 
     -[youtubeApi](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

* we have used Bulma CSS to style our index and movies pages
 Also we have use the Bulma modal card to display our previous searches
 
* we used local storage to gather and hold the search history to later be used
