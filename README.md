<h3>Some of the things we intend to do in the future include following through all the way to paid viewing options.
<br> To include sponsorship throughout all aspects of film memorabilia to include but not be limited to the official film poster other types of clothing and possibly even some fanpage sites. 
<br>Social media links to actors sites can be a further feature to add some user interactivity.
